    "Suppose your little sibling wants your help to check his math homework. He is done with his homework but wants you to see if all his results are correct. Since the student with all correct results gets 3 stars. However, you want your brother to check this on his own. So, you design a calculator for him in python. You could have given your scientific calculator but you wanted to give him a basic calculator and also wanted to see if you can even design one.\n",
